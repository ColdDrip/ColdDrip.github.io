So, this is my second post.
I still don't know what to write, but I just need to keep writing since it is in my yearly resolution. (crossing off Keep Writing from the list)


Okay, maybe I start with my portfolio and my CV. I just add a new page labeled Curiculum Vitae and while doing that I look back to my previous work, I had a site at <a href="http://dennyslinggar.carbonmade.com">Carbonmade</a> that I made few years ago just right before I graduated. When I look into it, I see all my previous work during study, it's all videos, mostly animation and some short movie (if you got there now, I have already update it to my latest work so you won't find all my previous work there). I have to say, <b>I changed. A lot.</b> At that time I thought I'm going to be a film maker, it is a fun job, and it would be cool when I tell people I work in the film industry, I make movies and such. But then, I got my first job as a front end designer. Needless to say I thought it would be a stepping stone before I got my real gig, but then as time goes by it grows on me. Actually I always enjoyed and interested in web development but I never thought it is cool, more on that later. 

So yeah, reflecting to 3 and a half years ago. Lots of things happened, and lots of things changes. You know what, I always want to start creative writin. Maybe I'll make a new section here and dedicate it for my creative writing. Maybe..

Oh, I add more resolution. And it is valid! Isn't it? I guess there are no rules that states that <em>"THOU SHAL LISTH YOUR ANNUAL RESOLUTIONTH BEFORE THE YEAR CHANGES"</em> (okay my ye olde english is bad).
