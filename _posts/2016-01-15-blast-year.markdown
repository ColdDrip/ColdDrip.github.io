<strong><h2>There was a Bomb in Jakarta!</h2></strong>

14 January 2016, there was a bomb in Jakarta yesterday morning. Around 11.00 AM.

It explodes in inner Jakarta, the more precise location is on Jalan MH Thamrin, in front of Sarinah. 

It is scary, as I frequently meeting friends around that area. And more especially because the suspect are said about to blow Starbucks, which I usually use as a meeting place with clients.

And the saddest thing is, Alan Rickman died. He was my favourite dark magic defense professor, and emo android. One less person I will never have a chance to meet. I really adores him, I really want to meet him.

Oh and it all happened on my birthday! I asked for a year full of blast, but not this kind of blast tho.
